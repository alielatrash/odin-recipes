- The goal behind this project is to test my HTML and GIT skills using minimal help from the internet as I go. 
- I want to be able to go through this project comfortably, but I also realize there are some elements here and there that I might not be too great at. 
- This will serve me later as I will rememeber where I fell through and help me study harder. 

LET'S GO! Let's push and commit.
